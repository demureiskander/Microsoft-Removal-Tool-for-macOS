# Microsoft Removal Tool for macOS

This script completely removes all Microsoft applications and components from your Mac, including licenses, services, settings, and keychain entries. Perfect for a clean reinstall of Office or if you want to erase every trace of Microsoft software from your system.

## 🔥 What the script removes

- **Applications:** Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, OneDrive, AutoUpdate, **Microsoft Defender**, Teams (if present)
- **System services:** LaunchDaemons, LaunchAgents, PrivilegedHelperTools
- **Containers and settings:** folders in `~/Library/Containers`, `~/Library/Group Containers`, `~/Library/Preferences`
- **Caches and support files:** `/Library/Caches`, `~/Library/Caches`, `/Library/Application Support/Microsoft`
- **Keychain:** all entries related to `microsoft`, `office`, `live.com`
- **Package receipts:** forgets `pkgutil` records so the system considers the software completely removed

## 🚀 How to use

1. **Download the script** (or copy the code below into a file named `uninstall_ms.sh`).
2. Open **Terminal** and navigate to the folder containing the script:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/folder
   ```
3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x uninstall_ms.sh
   ```
4. Run it with administrator privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo ./uninstall_ms.sh
   ```
5. Restart your Mac after completion – this is mandatory for a full cleanup (optional / recomded).

## ⚠️ Important warnings

Irreversible: after running the script, all Microsoft applications and data will be permanently deleted. Files in iCloud/OneDrive remain in the cloud, but local copies are erased.

### 💾 Backup recommendation
The script is designed to work correctly and is safe to use, but as with any system modification, we recommend having a backup just in case. Creating a Time Machine backup beforehand ensures you can restore your system if something unexpected happens.

### 🔑 Microsoft office licenses
The script removes all Microsoft license files and keychain entries. This ensures that after running it, your system has no traces of previous Microsoft software, allowing for a completely fresh installation if you choose to reinstall later.

### 💻 Compatibility
tested on macOS Ventura, Sonoma, Sequoia (both Apple Silicon and Intel).

### 🛡️ Microsoft Defender quirk
Microsoft Defender quirk: the script attempts to remove Microsoft Defender.app, but sometimes application remains. If after reboot the Defender icon still appears in the Applications folder, use [AppCleaner](freemacsoft.net/appcleaner) to find and remove any leftover files. The script already covers the main Defender files, but manual intervention may be needed for the stub.

## ❓ Why might Defender remain? / What to do if Defender doesn't get removed?

### Why might Defender remain?
Even after running the main script, some associated files of Microsoft Defender can be left behind because they are stored in multiple protected system folders. A standard removal script might not catch all of them.

### What to do if Defender doesn't get removed?
We strongly recommend using AppCleaner. It’s a free tool that scans for every file related to an application and removes them completely. Just drag Microsoft Defender.app into AppCleaner, and it will do the rest.

- Download AppCleaner from freemacsoft.net/appcleaner

- Or install via Homebrew:
  ```bash
  brew install --cask appcleaner
  ```
